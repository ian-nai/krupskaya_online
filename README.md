# Welcome

This site is intended to provide an online home for English-language resources relating to Nadezhda Krupskaya, Deputy Education Commissar of the Soviet Union from 1929 to 1939, who played a vital role in the development and administration of Soviet librarianship and libraries.

This website was built using the Hyde theme. Hyde is a brazen two-column [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.
